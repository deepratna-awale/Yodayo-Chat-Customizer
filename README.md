## Installation

**Requirements:**
- A userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

**To install:**
1. Make sure you have a userscript manager extension installed in your browser.
2. Copy and paste the following URL into your browser's address bar:

   ```
   https://github.com/pervertir/Yodayo-Chat-Customizer/raw/refs/heads/main/MoescapeCustomUI.user.js
   ```

3. Your userscript extension will detect the script and prompt you to install it.

## Usage

### Chat Customizer
1. Once installed, use the settings cog (in the top right corner) in your chat to access the added features.

3. **Enhanced Features & Improved Workflow:**
   - **Real-time Preview**: See your changes instantly as you customize
   - **Smart Defaults**: The system automatically captures original backgrounds for easy restoration
   - **URL & File Support**: Upload images directly or paste URLs for both backgrounds and character images
   - **Temporary Storage**: Your changes are preserved even if you don't save immediately
   - **Performance Optimized**: Smooth operation with optimized CSS injection and caching

4. You must click **Save** to store your changes in the database. If you don't press save, your changes will not persist the next time you open the chat.
5. **Delete** will remove the Chat ID from the database (removing the settings you saved for the current chat only).
6. **Delete All** will remove the character from the database, which will remove the saved theme for all chats of that character.
7. If you want to change the theme for all chats (not just a specific character), check **Apply Color Scheme Universally**. This will only store the colors, so you can still upload different images per character/chat.
8. **Unchecking** "Set as Character Theme" before saving will save the theme for the current chat only.

### Image Viewer
This feature allows you to see all characters stored in your database with an improved interface.

### Background Image Collection
We've created a comprehensive collection of default background images that you can use with the customizer. These high-quality backgrounds are categorized by theme and setting to help you find the perfect atmosphere for your chats.

**üìÅ [View Background Collection ‚Üí](backgrounds.md)**

The collection includes:
- **Basic Backgrounds**: Transparent, black, and white options
- **Bedroom Scenes**: Clean, cyberpunk, red, and tatami styles
- **Cityscapes**: Medieval markets, night scenes, and post-apocalyptic settings
- **Japanese Settings**: Classrooms, cherry blossom paths, and university scenes
- **Fantasy & Nature**: Magical treehouses with fireworks and air balloons
- **Landscapes**: Autumn trees, beaches, mountains, and winter scenes
- **Special Locations**: Royal chambers and medieval taverns

Each background image includes:
- High-resolution preview
- Ready-to-copy GitHub raw URL (with copy button)
- Easy categorization for quick browsing
- Direct compatibility with the customizer's URL input field

## Troubleshooting

**Performance Issues:**
- The latest update includes significant performance improvements with CSS caching and optimized operations
- If you experience slowness, try refreshing the page to clear any cached data

**Image Loading Problems:**
- Both URLs and file uploads are now supported with automatic format detection
- If images don't load, check the browser console for error messages

**Settings Not Saving:**
- Ensure you click the **Save** button after making changes
- Check that your browser allows local storage for the Yodayo domain

## FAQ

**Q: Will this break if Yodayo updates?**  
A: The script has been updated with improved error handling and resilience. While some features may still break if the site changes significantly, the latest version is more robust and includes fallback mechanisms. Please open an issue if you notice anything not working.

**Q: Where are my settings stored?**  
A: All settings are stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB. This provides better performance and reliability compared to traditional storage methods. Clearing your browser data will remove your customizations.

**Q: Can I use this on other browsers?**  
A: Yes, as long as your browser supports userscript managers like Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey. The latest updates have improved cross-browser compatibility.

**Q: What's new in the recent updates?**  
A: Major performance improvements, better error handling, real-time preview functionality, enhanced image support (URLs + files), optimized database operations, and improved user experience with temporary data management.

**Q: How do I report issues or suggest features?**  
A: Please open an issue on the GitHub repository with detailed information about the problem or suggestion. Include browser version, userscript manager, and steps to reproduce any issues.
