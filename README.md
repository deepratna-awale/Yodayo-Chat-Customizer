Customize Moescape/Yodayo Tavern chat to your liking.

## Overview
Yodayo Chat Customizer is a userscript that allows you to fully customize the appearance and behavior of the Yodayo chat interface. This project is a work in progress and open to contributions.

## Features

- Save, delete, and manage chat/character themes
- Image viewer for all stored characters
- Easy-to-use UI integrated into the chat
- Settings persist via local database
- Lightweight and easy to install

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- A userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

**To install:**
1. Make sure you have a userscript manager extension installed in your browser.
2. Copy and paste the following URL into your browser's address bar:

   ```
   https://github.com/deepratna-awale/Yodayo-Chat-Customizer/raw/refs/heads/main/MoescapeCustomUI.user.js
   ```

3. Your userscript extension will detect the script and prompt you to install it.

## Usage

3. Some features may break as the site updates. Please report issues if you encounter them.
4. You must click **Save** to store your changes in the database. If you don't press save, your changes will not persist the next time you open the chat.
5. **Delete** will remove the Chat ID from the database (removing the settings you saved for the current chat only).
6. **Delete All** will remove the character from the database, which will remove the saved theme for all chats of that character.
7. If you want to change the theme for all chats (not just a specific character), check **Apply Color Scheme Universally**. This will only store the colors, so you can still upload different images per character/chat.
8. **Unchecking** "Set as Character Theme" before saving will save the theme for the current chat only.

### Image Viewer
This feature allows you to see all characters stored in your database.
